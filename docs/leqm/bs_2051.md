# ITU-R BS.2051-3

* Title:  **Advanced sound system for programme production**
* URL: [itu.int/rec/R-REC-BS.1770-5-202311-I/en](https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-BS.1770-5-202311-I/en)

## Scope

This Recommendation specifies an advanced sound system with and without accompanying picture. An
advanced sound system is a system with a reproduction configuration beyond those specified in
Recommendation ITU-R BS.775 or a system with any reproduction configuration that can support
channel-based, object-based or scene-based input signals or their combination with metadata. An advanced
sound system uses audio data in combination with an appropriate set of metadata to specify a sound scene to
be delivered/broadcasted. The specifications include requirements for signalling the properties of advanced
sound content and loudspeaker layout to be used in content production for advanced sound systems. The
advanced sound system can apply to the sound component of television and expanded large screen digital
imagery (LSDI) programmes, as well as for sound only programmes.

The ITU Radiocommunication Assembly,
considering

* a) that Recommendation ITU-R BS.775 – Multichannel stereophonic sound system with and
without accompanying picture, specifies a multichannel stereophonic sound system with three front
channels and two rear/side channels together with an optional low frequency effect (LFE) channel,
as the highest level in a hierarchy of multichannel sound systems that range from 1/0 (monophonic)
up to 3/2;
* b) that Recommendation ITU-R BT.709 – Parameter values for the HDTV standards for
production and international programme exchange, specifies HDTV system image parameters;
* c) that Recommendation ITU-R BT.2020 – Parameter values for ultra-high definition television
systems for production and international programme exchange, specifies UHDTV image system
parameters;
* d) that the wide field of view image presentation of HDTV and ultra-high definition television
(UHDTV) programmes benefit from spatially enhanced sound beyond the 5.1 channel sound;
* e) that Recommendation ITU-R BS.1909 – Performance requirements for an advanced
multichannel stereophonic sound system for use with or without accompanying picture, specifies the
requirements for an advanced sound system with or without accompanying picture;
* f) that Report ITU-R BS.2159 – Multichannel sound technology in home and broadcasting
applications, includes the results of subjective evaluation experiments on loudspeaker layout to meet
the requirements described in Recommendation ITU-R BS.1909,

## recommends

1 that static or dynamic metadata/descriptors meeting the requirements described in Annex 1
should be used to signal the properties of all audio signals used in an advanced sound system in order
to fully represent the desired audio content;
2 that a system with a reproduction configuration beyond those specified in Recommendation
ITU-R BS.775 or a system with any reproduction configurations described in Annex 1 that can
support channel-based, object-based or scene-based input signals or their combination with audiorelated metadata should be considered for production of advanced sound programmes;
3 that the appropriate number of audio elements1 and reproduction configurations in
programme production should be a choice by agreement between the producer and the recipient in
the programme exchange;
4 that consumer interactions with the received audio should be facilitated in the production and
broadcast sound system and that its characteristics should be a choice by agreement between the
producer and the recipient in the programme exchange,

## further recommends

1 that further work should be conducted to provide information about the features of any
advanced sound system according to this Recommendation to fulfil the quality requirements of
Recommendation ITU-R BS.1909;
2 that only new sound systems to be used in broadcasting content production should be added
in Annex 1. New sound systems should be a clear expansion from the other sound systems already
specified in Annex 1 and their common parts should be as compatible as possible. Such sound systems
should be specified by the loudspeaker layout (positions and their ranges), the channel labels and their
ordering.
