## Scope

This Recommendation specifies audio measurement algorithms for the purpose of determining subjective
programme loudness, and true-peak signal level.

## Keywords

3/2 multichannel sound system, advanced sound system, loudness, true-peak signal level
The ITU Radiocommunication Assembly,
considering

* a) that modern digital sound transmission techniques offer an extremely wide dynamic range;
* b) that modern digital sound production and transmission techniques provide a mixture of mono,
stereo and 3/2 multichannel formats specified in Recommendation ITU-R BS.775 and advanced
sound formats including channel-, object- and scene-based input signals and their combination with
metadata specified in Recommendation ITU-R BS.2051, and that sound programmes are produced in
all of these formats;
* c) that listeners desire the subjective loudness of audio programmes to be uniform for different
sources and programme types;
* d) that many methods are available for the measurement of audio levels but that existing
measurement methods employed in programme production do not provide the indication of subjective
loudness;
* e) that, for the purpose of loudness control in programme exchange, in order to reduce audience
annoyance, it is essential to have a single recommended algorithm for the objective estimation of
subjective loudness;
* f) that future complex algorithms based on psychoacoustic models may provide improved
objective measures of loudness for a wide variety of audio programmes;
* g) that digital media overloads abruptly, and thus even momentary overload should be avoided,
considering further
    * a) that peak signal levels may increase due to commonly applied processes such as filtering or
bit-rate reduction;
    * b) that existing metering technologies do not reflect the true-peak level contained in a digital
signal since the true-peak value may occur between samples;
    * c) that the state of digital signal processing makes it practical to implement an algorithm that
closely estimates the true-peak level of a signal;
    * d) that the use of a true-peak level indicating algorithm will allow accurate indication of the
headroom between the peak level of a digital audio signal and the clipping level,

## recommends

* 1 that when an objective measure of the loudness of an audio channel or programme, produced
with up to five main channels per Recommendation ITU-R BS.775 (mono source, stereo and 3/2
multichannel sound), is required to facilitate programme delivery and exchange, the algorithm
specified in Annex 1 should be used;
* 2 that when an objective measure of the loudness of an audio programme produced with a
larger number of channels (such as the channel configurations specified in Recommendation ITU-R
BS.2051) is required, the algorithm specified in Annex 3 should be used;
* 3 that when an objective measure of the loudness of object-based audio signals or combination
of channel- and object-based audio signals is required, the algorithm specified in Annex 4 should be
used;
* 4 that methods employed in programme production and post-production to indicate programme
loudness may be based on the algorithm specified in Annexes 1, 3 and 4;
* 5 that when an indication of true-peak level of a digital audio signal is required, the
measurement method should be based on the guidelines shown in Annex 2, or on a method that gives
similar or superior results,

## further recommends

* 1 that consideration should be given to the possible need to update this Recommendation in the
event that new loudness algorithms are shown to provide performance that is significantly improved
over the algorithm specified in Annexes 1, 3 and 4;
* 2 that this Recommendation should be updated when new algorithms have been developed to
enable the measurement of audio programme loudness for scene-based audio programmes.
* NOTE 1 – Users should be aware that measured loudness is an estimation of subjective loudness and
involves some degree of uncertainty depending on listeners, audio material and listening conditions.
* NOTE 2 – For testing compliance of meters according to this Recommendation, test material from
the set described in Report ITU-R BS.2217 may be used.
